      the 'head' element contains various data that aren't
      rendered to the browser. This includes things such as
      the 'title' elem which specifies the name that will show
      in browser tab titles etc.

      this is also where we put link elems that tell browsers
      which extra files it needs to load - CSS files etc. It loads
      them in the order that you put them (ie, a second CSS file
      can override styles that were set in the first one)

      this would also be where you should put script elems if you
      want to add any javascript to your site.

      <!--
        the #main elem is the central column of the document
        which contains all the actual text etc of the page.

        the document is shaped something like this grid:

        +---------------------------------+
        | TITLE                           |
        +---------------------------------+
        | main text            | side bar |
        |                      |          |
        ...
        |                      |          |
        +----------------------+----------+
        |             footer              |
        +---------------------------------+

        but we can't actually create a grid directly with HTML & CSS
        (it's coming to CSS soon), but this doesn't matter. What we'll
        do instead is put the main section and the side bar inside a
        parent element, which we split horizontally. Then we can put
        that parent element with the header & footer and split the
        document vertically into three.

        the heirachy is like this:

        #main
          +- header
          |     +- title
          |     +- subtitle
          +- #centre
          |     +- #content
          |     |     +- ...
          |     +- #sidebar
          |           +- ...
          +- footer
                +- ...
      -->

        <!-- sub title -->
        <!-- <p>Astrophysicist &amp; Badass</p> -->

            this is the main body of the site. I don't know
            what you intend to put here (perhaps what you're
            working on, talks you're giving etc?) so I'm just
            going to copy a bunch of text about stars from

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          
          
          <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher studying the early stages of star formation through both observation and modelling.  I am currently working at the National University of Ireland Galway.</p>

	  <p>I study the collapse of molecular clouds to form the next generation of stars, primarily using continuum and spectroscopic observations taken at submillimetre and millimetre wavelengths with telescopes such as the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and the Submillimeter Array.  My main area of research is the energy balance within star-forming regions, which I am currently investigating both observationally and through analytical modelling.</p>

	  <p>I am currently working on polarimetric observations of nearby molecular clouds as a member of the BISTRO (B-Fields in Star-forming Regions) survey, using the POL-2 polarimeter on the JCMT.  My aim is to determine the magnetic field strength and direction in potentially star-forming cores in nearby molecular clouds.  This will for the first time allow a determination of the full energy balance of a statistically-significant sample of star-forming cores.</p>
